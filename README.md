## _New!_ Sign Language Names

We manually verified the sign language names for languages registered in the IANA Language Subtag Registry,
under [`custom/signedLanguages/en.json`](custom/signedLanguages/en.json).
We then automatically translated this to other languages using Google Translate.

We also aim to support `signedLanguagesShort`, which is a shorter version of the language name.
For example, "American Sign Language" would be "American", or "International Sign" would be "International".

We verified and created short names for:
English, Hebrew, French, German.

It would be great if you could help us verify the translations!
